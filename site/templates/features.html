<h1>Features</h1>
<p>Here list some highlights why we use Jangod template engine.</p>
<h2>Template Inheritance</h2>
<p>Template Inheritance is Jangod engine's most important and flexible feature, and 
also the most useful function. Through sub-block override, it provides the simplest 
consistent modification, templates can be reused in a maximum. That's main reason
and drive of creating this engine.
</p>
<h2>General purpose</h2>
<p>Can be used to generate any kind of text like HTML, XML, JAVA, SQL, etc, without 
any conflict.
</p>
<h2>Simple syntax</h2>
<p>Jangod template syntax is easy to learn, you can fully grasp in 10 minutes. 
Using engine just need to know 4 elements('{\{', '{\%', '{\#', '{\!'). 
If you keep 3 libraries'(tag, filter, macro) usage in mind, then master it a hundred 
percent. For details see <a href="userguide.html" alt="user guide">user guide</a>. 
I's not recommended making much complex calculation or logic in template code.
If really do so, there is still a viable approach, use filters or even customize tags 
and filters to use.
</p>
<h2>Forgiveness</h2>
<p>Usually don't need to care about the <a name="forgiveness">special characters</a>. 
Template syntax parse is intelligent while dealing with characters, actually only 
'{\{', '{\%', '{\#', '{\!' were really considered to be special characters, 
inserting a slash '\' in the middle to replace them. Other characters, 
such as '{', '}', '}}', '%}', ... will be treated as general text output if not matched.
</p>
<h2>Uniform</h2>
<p>Uniform data access method is a dot '.' . If the data is an object, 'obj.prop' 
acts as 'obj.getProp()'; if an array, 'arr.1' acts as 'arr[1]'; if a collection, 
'list.1' acts as 'list.get(1)'; if a map, 'map.key' acts as 'map.get(key)'.
</p>
<h2>Configurable</h2>
<p>Template's entire render process, from loading to presentment are configurable. 
Where and how to get templates (local, network, database), text encoding, 
whether and how to cache templates or parsing result etc., can be setup in the 
configuration file to meet your requirements. With further development, 
configurability will be more complete, more flexible. 
</p>
<h2>Free customization</h2>
<p>Conventional extensions, file loader, cache, data container, etc.
Core expansions, the three library items are free to expand or cover. Library 
item's invoked specification can be regulated to your own, ruling distinctive 
template syntax as you like. For example, make a new tag which will define 
variables in template file while running, as follow: 
<div class="code">
<pre>
{\%  define
    int i = 10;
    string str = "hello world";
    tuple arr = (i, str, 'java engine');
    dict dc = {a:'freemarker', b:'velocity', c:'django'}; 
%}
</pre>
</div>
Nothing impossible.
</p>
<h2>High efficiency</h2>
<p>Jangod supports multi-thread, pre-compiled, refactor of template elements,
they all help to optimize the efficiency of render.
